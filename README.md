# jQuery: hotSpot

A jQuery plugin to create block links.

This is useful where an HTML5-style block link cannot be used due to the presence of nested links.

It also allows you to cut down on duplicate links (e.g. image and heading pointing to the same location), which creates less noise for screenreader users.

__Please note: this plugin is optimised for internal Chrometoaster use. YMMV.__

## Installation

1. In Terminal: `cd /PATH/TO/PROJECT-THEME-FOLDER`
1. `bower install https://github.com/chrometoasters/ct-jquery-hotSpot.git`

Note: if you wish to customise where Bower puts installed components, you may add a `.bowerrc` file into this folder:

        {
            "directory" : "PATH/TO/COMPONENTS"
        }
